# HR Attrition Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data to identify the key factors influencing employee turnover. Using Python and Power BI, it provides insights to help organizations improve employee retention and make data-driven HR decisions.

## Abstract
Employee attrition can significantly impact an organization’s productivity and cost structure. This project applies data analytics techniques to explore relationships between job satisfaction, salary, age, and work-life balance. The final Power BI dashboard visually presents findings, helping HR teams predict and mitigate attrition risks effectively.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python** – Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization and statistical analysis  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development and documentation environment

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection:** Loaded HR dataset (`Cleaned_HR_Attrition.csv`) containing employee records.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, standardized columns, and encoded categorical variables.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends and correlations between features and attrition.  
4. **Visualization:** Created detailed plots and built an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
5. **Insight Generation:** Highlighted factors like overtime, low salary, and low job satisfaction as major attrition drivers.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI report (`HR-Attrition.pbix`) provides a visual summary of:
- Attrition by department, gender, and job role  
- Impact of salary, years at company, and satisfaction level  
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) for HR analytics  

---
## Key Insights
- Employees with **low job satisfaction** and **overtime workloads** are more likely to leave.  
- **Monthly income** and **years at company** show strong correlation with attrition rates.  
- Younger employees and those in specific departments experience higher turnover.

## Conclusion
This project highlights how data analytics can transform HR management by predicting and reducing attrition. Combining Python’s analytical power with Power BI’s visual capabilities makes it easier for HR professionals to interpret complex workforce patterns.
